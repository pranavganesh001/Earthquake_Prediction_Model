Earthquake_Prediction_Model

Earthquakes pose significant risks to human life and infrastructure, making their prediction crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation.
This project focuses on developing an Earthquake Prediction Model using machine learning techniques.
The model aims to predict the likelihood of seismic events by analyzing historical earthquake data and parameters.


The projectâ€™s key objectives include:
Data Collection,
Exploring the data,
Data Cleaning, and
Plotting various charts on the data: 
      Scatter Plot of Earthquake Locations using (Longitudes and Lattitudes).
      Histogram of the Earthquake Magnitudes.
      Line Graph depicting Earthquake Activity over time.
      Scatter plot showing the relation between depth and magnitude.
      Heat Map.
      Pair Plot.
Clustering the earthquake locations using KMeans Clustering and plotting a scatter plot of the earthquake clusters.
Training and Testing the model on Simple Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict the magnitude of earthquakes.
Calculating the Error (RMSE) for both the models.
